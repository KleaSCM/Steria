## System Overview

Steria is a modular version control system designed for clarity, extensibility, and performance. The architecture separates core versioning logic, CLI commands, web interface, and utilities for maintainability and scalability.

### High-Level Diagram

## Module Breakdown

- **core/**: Core repository logic, high-level operations
- **internal/storage/**: File/object storage, commit management, performance
- **internal/security/**: Cryptography, signatures, secure hashing
- **internal/metrics/**: Profiling, performance metrics
- **internal/utils/**: Ignore patterns, helpers
- **cmd/**: CLI command implementations (repository, branching, workflow, projects)
- **Docs/**: Documentation and guides
- **Tests/**: Unit, integration, and performance tests

## Key Design Decisions

- **Modular CLI:** Each command is a separate module for clarity and testability
- **Blob Storage:** File contents are stored as blobs, enabling efficient diffs and restores
- **Commit Objects:** Commits reference file blobs and parent commits for full history
- **Performance Profiling:** Built-in metrics for every operation
- **Extensible Web UI:** Web server is isolated and can be extended for collaboration
- **Security by Default:** All actions are signed, and cryptographic primitives are used throughout

## Extensibility
- New commands can be added by creating new modules in `cmd/`
- Storage and security layers are designed for easy enhancement (e.g., encryption, distributed storage)
- Web interface can be extended for real-time collaboration, code review, and more
